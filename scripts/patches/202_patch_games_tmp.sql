     '"The World of Alice" is an educational program on CD-ROM based on Lewis Carroll''s book "Alice in Wonderland." For the first time on CD, an attempt has been made to recreate the fairy-tale world in an interactive mode, conveying the wonderful spirit and charm of this work.',
     '"Alice in Wonderland" is undoubtedly one of the masterpieces of world literature. It is one of the rare works that has spawned so many books and articles with commentary. Just think of all the movies and cartoons made based on this story. "Alice" has been translated into almost all languages of the world, but as Boris Zakhoder claims, "it''s easier to transport England than to translate Alice." This adventure book, a puzzle book whose lines are often built on wordplay, is amazingly lyrical and filled with deep philosophical meaning. The story, told one and a half centuries ago during a countryside walk by an unknown mathematics teacher to two little girls, brought him worldwide fame and immortality.

"The World of Alice" is an educational program on CD-ROM based on Lewis Carroll''s book "Alice in Wonderland." For the first time on CD, an attempt has been made to recreate the fairy-tale world in an interactive mode, conveying the wonderful spirit and charm of this work.

The disc contains the original English text of "Alice in Wonderland," a little-known early translation by Vladimir Nabokov, the most popular retelling by Boris Zakhoder, the philologically accurate translation by Vladimir Orloff, and a completely new retelling by Boris Balter. However, reading the book in English is no easy task, especially one with such deep subtext, built on puns and parodies. Therefore, the original text is provided with a dictionary and special links. If you don''t understand a word, hovering the cursor over it will bring up an instant translation. If you want to know more, there is a whole system of "explanations" - linguistic, historical, and even philosophical - for each word and expression.

"What use is a book without pictures and conversation?" wondered Alice. Indeed! The book on CD has plenty of conversation. The English text is voiced by actor Jim Donner, and the Russian (as well as the commentary) by Boris Zakhoder. And the pictures? You will find drawings by Lewis Carroll himself from the rare facsimile edition of "Alice''s Adventures Underground," illustrations by John Tenniel. It is worth noting that the first edition of "Alice" was published with black-and-white illustrations by John Tenniel. Subsequently, the artist colored thirteen of his drawings. Tenniel''s color illustrations were specially reconstructed for this program using computer capabilities to select a palette from the original drawings. Additionally, you will find amusing illustrations by Tatyana Yarygina and fragments of the famous animated film, which has become a classic, "Alice in Wonderland" by TO "Ekran".',

Fans of Carroll''s parodies and logical exercises will enjoy numerous comments and notes, and the most curious will even be able to delve into the secrets of modern physics and semantics.

Numerous illustrations created by different artists, animations, fragments from the cartoon, and photographs taken by Lewis Carroll himself will delight both children and adults.',

It was during his journeys that the Avatar unearthed a chilling artifact: the skull of Mondain the Wicked, the first of the Triad of Evil. There were those who claimed that the artifact held the power to destroy all life on our world. Fortunately, it was the Stranger who discovered it, and not someone of lesser Virtue.

Upon completing the Path of the Eight Virtues, the Avatar embarked on a search for the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. Legend linked this ancient tome with the subterranean maze known as the Great Stygian Abyss. “Truly, no one has ever plumbed its depths,” wrote Shamino, who arranged by magic to obtain a map of its corridors. “I cannot imagine the horrors that await the first to venture into the Stygian depths.',

Each campaign is divided up into multiple missions. The usual gameplay in each mission consists of choosing the route for the railroad on a grid to connect one city to the next. There is a set budget for each mission, and exceeding that budget will fail the mission. There are sections of interest on the map, and building your railroad into that section can cause an event to occur. This can be good, bad, or give you a choice. For example, workers might start leaving to go to a local gold mine. The decision is to pay the workers more, get more workers, or force the workers to work harder. These decisions are presented by your loyal advisors: Calamity Jane, Wild Bill Hickok, and Tomahawk Beckwourth.
The other section of the game is that someone has stolen the golden spike, and recruited six of the wildest outlaws of the wild west to sabotage your railroad. From time to time, a mission will arise to either deal with sabotage or capture an outlaw. These sections are isometric, and play like an adventure game.',

This is a first-person adventure game which plays similar to a role-playing dungeon crawler without experience points.

The inventory additionally holds utility (e.g. armor or weapons) and recovery items which improve health when used.
Sometimes is is required to converse of fight with people. Combat takes place on a separate screen and both combatants have three postures: neutral, attack and defense. After entering the attack stance with a left click, the strength bar fills up and a second click attacks the enemy. Unless they are in a defense stance, they take attack based on how much strength was used. While waiting for the bar, the player is exposed to enemy attacks.
