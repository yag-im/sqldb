     '"The World of Alice" is an educational program on CD-ROM based on Lewis Carroll''s book "Alice in Wonderland." For the first time on CD, an attempt has been made to recreate the fairy-tale world in an interactive mode, conveying the wonderful spirit and charm of this work.',
     '"Alice in Wonderland" is undoubtedly one of the masterpieces of world literature. It is one of the rare works that has spawned so many books and articles with commentary. Just think of all the movies and cartoons made based on this story. "Alice" has been translated into almost all languages of the world, but as Boris Zakhoder claims, "it''s easier to transport England than to translate Alice." This adventure book, a puzzle book whose lines are often built on wordplay, is amazingly lyrical and filled with deep philosophical meaning. The story, told one and a half centuries ago during a countryside walk by an unknown mathematics teacher to two little girls, brought him worldwide fame and immortality.

"The World of Alice" is an educational program on CD-ROM based on Lewis Carroll''s book "Alice in Wonderland." For the first time on CD, an attempt has been made to recreate the fairy-tale world in an interactive mode, conveying the wonderful spirit and charm of this work.

The disc contains the original English text of "Alice in Wonderland," a little-known early translation by Vladimir Nabokov, the most popular retelling by Boris Zakhoder, the philologically accurate translation by Vladimir Orloff, and a completely new retelling by Boris Balter. However, reading the book in English is no easy task, especially one with such deep subtext, built on puns and parodies. Therefore, the original text is provided with a dictionary and special links. If you don''t understand a word, hovering the cursor over it will bring up an instant translation. If you want to know more, there is a whole system of "explanations" - linguistic, historical, and even philosophical - for each word and expression.

"What use is a book without pictures and conversation?" wondered Alice. Indeed! The book on CD has plenty of conversation. The English text is voiced by actor Jim Donner, and the Russian (as well as the commentary) by Boris Zakhoder. And the pictures? You will find drawings by Lewis Carroll himself from the rare facsimile edition of "Alice''s Adventures Underground," illustrations by John Tenniel. It is worth noting that the first edition of "Alice" was published with black-and-white illustrations by John Tenniel. Subsequently, the artist colored thirteen of his drawings. Tenniel''s color illustrations were specially reconstructed for this program using computer capabilities to select a palette from the original drawings. Additionally, you will find amusing illustrations by Tatyana Yarygina and fragments of the famous animated film, which has become a classic, "Alice in Wonderland" by TO "Ekran".',

You can also listen to the entire fairy tale from start to finish, performed by the English actor Jim Donoher.
